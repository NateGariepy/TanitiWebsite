					<h1>Our Favorites</h1>
					<h2>Yasawa Island Resort and Spa</h2>
					<p>
                        At the remote edge of Taniti's Yasawa island chain is where you'll find Yasawa Island Resort and Spa.
                        This luxurious all-inclusive getaway also happens to be one of the most romantic resorts in the region.
                        Sweethearts can embark on a champagne picnic to one of the eleven private beaches on the island, where privacy is nearly guaranteed.
                        A candlelit dinner in the sand will also help keep the spark alight.
                        The resort is strictly adults-only except for dedicated weeks throughout the year when families are welcome.

					<h2>Kokomi Private Island Taniti</h2>
					<p>
                        The act of traveling to Kokomo Private Island Fiji is an adventure.
                        Your trip begins at a private hangar at Nadi International Airport, where you’re served fresh snacks and drinks before boarding a helicopter or seaplane to reach Kokomo Private Island Fiji.
                        The resort is found at the edge of the Great Astrolabe Reef, one of the most extensive fringing coral reefs in the world and a haven for incredible marine life like manta rays, reef sharks, sea turtles, and soft corals.
                        Though it’s easy to spend all day scuba diving, snorkeling, and learning more about the island’s resident manta population through Kokomo’s collaboration with Manta Trust Fiji, a marine conservation organization, you’ll want to make plenty of time for the onsite spa and hilltop yoga shala.
                        Accommodations range from romantic beachside bures with private infinity pools to spacious family-friendly villas with panoramic views. Dining on Kokomo Private Island Fiji is a unique experience that manages to blend a laid-back ambiance with fine dining cuisine. Menus are updated daily with many dishes crafted from ingredients grown on the island’s farm.
					</p>
					<h2>Octopus Resort</h2>
					<p>
						Octopus Resort on Waya Island is one of the few resorts in Taniti where you can have many of the amenities and services of the four- and five-star hotels at a lower price, thanks to its dorm rooms with beds starting at just $23 per night.
                        For guests who want privacy, there are also various suites, one-, two-, and three-bedroom villas that range from $250 to $1,077 per night.
                        Steps away from the resort is a spectacular coral reef with many types of soft corals, anemones (and their resident clownfish), sea turtles, reef sharks, eels, and other forms of sea life.
                        The resort also hosts excursions to swim with manta rays, scuba and snorkel trips, village visits, and community quiz nights.
                        If you’re a solo traveler, Octopus Resort is one of the best ways to meet others in a social environment without forgoing luxury.
                        The active kids club with crafts workshops, dance lessons, games, and snorkel trips make this resort an easy pick for active families.
