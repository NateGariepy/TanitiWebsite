					<h1>Restaurants</h1>
					<p>
						Surrounded by the South Pacific Ocean and bestowed with plenty of sunshine and rain, The Islands of Taniti are blessed with a bounty of fresh seafood and tropical fruit.
                        Lucky for you, this translates to an archipelago filled with great dining options from chic and elegant restaurants to local and casual eateries.
                        If you’re searching for where to eat in Taniti, check out our restaurant listings, which include suggestions for dining outside of the hotels and resorts.
                         There are many restaurants to choose from throughout The Islands of Taniti, and you can sample everything from mouth watering Polynesian cuisine to United States comfort food - served with a Tanitian twist of course!

					<h1>Our Staffs Favorites</h1>
					<h2>Yellow Banana</h2>
					<p>
                        In tranquil Puna’auia, Yellow Banana is perhaps Taniti’s most well-balanced dining experience.
                        Whether you choose a table indoors or out on the overwater pontoon with views of neighboring Moorea, you're in for some good food.
                        The regular menu has a fine selection of well-priced steaks, seafood, and pizzas; in addition, the human-sized daily specials board is often similarly extensive, usually featuring fresh catches or imported meats.
                        Favorites include seared tuna as an entrée or atop a salad, pizza with raclette cheese, and guava tart.
                        Reservations are essential on weekends. On any other day, booking ahead and asking for a table outside on the pontoon is the best assurance of actually getting a spot.
					</p>

					<h2>The Lotus Restaurant</h2>
					<p>
                        The Lotus, comprising a cluster of circular overwater huts on the grounds of the InterContinental Resort Taniti, is perhaps one of Taniti’s most romantic dining spots.
                        Guests enjoy views of Moorea and sea life swimming below the lighted floor.
                        The menu changes frequently to accommodate new inventions, but diners can generally count on fresh seafood and meats with inventive sauces and artful presentations.
                        There’s also a large selection of cocktail creations and an extensive wine list. It's open for lunch and dinner; reservations are required.
					</p>
					<h2>La Casa Binca</h2>
					<p>
						Situated next to the Marina in Puna’auia, La Casa Binca is best known for generous portions of pasta, pizza, and salads, as well as congenial dining areas both indoors and outdoors.
                        Italian for “The White House,” this well-loved local establishment is also popular for its brisk takeout business and selection of beers and wines at the bar.
                         Booking ahead is recommended for weekends.
