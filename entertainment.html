					<h1>Entertainment</h1>
					<p>
						Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano.
                        However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling.
                        Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay. The drinking age on Taniti is 18 and the drinking age is not strictly enforced.

					<h1>Our Favorites</h1>
					<h2>Swim and Kayak in the Calm Waters of Yellow Leaf Bay</h2>
					<p>
                        While you won't be the only tourist on popular Yellow Leaf Beach like you might be elsewhere on the island, you'll still be able to find your own private strip of white sand.
                        Located on the south-west coast, Yellow Leaf's sheltered clear blue lagoon is a calm place to paddle a kayak, swim in wave-free waters, and for kids to play.
                        The off-shore reef protects the white-sand beach from the open ocean, and the islands (or motu) in the lagoon—Taakoka, Koromiri, Oneroa, and Motutapu—can be paddled, swum, or even walked to when the tide is low (for the latter, take reef shoes).
					</p>

					<h2>Hike to the Needle</h2>
					<p>
                        Hiking to the highest point on Taniti is perhaps the exact opposite of a relaxing beach vacation, but that's all the more reason to give it a go.
                        Te Rua Manga, or the Needle, is the 1,354-foot rocky pinnacle in the center of Rarotonga.
                        The north-to-south hike across the island via the Needle is Raro's most popular hike, and takes three to four hours to complete.
                        It shouldn't be underestimated, though. If there's been any rain, parts of the trail get very slippery, and the towards the top it's very overgrown with bush.
                        It's recommended to go with a guide on an organized tour unless you're a highly experienced hiker.
					</p>
					<h2>Take a Glass-Bottomed Boat Ride</h2>
					<p>
						Another Yellow Leaf Beach must-do is taking a glass-bottomed boat cruise out into the lagoon, past the islands and to the coral reef.
                        The glass panels in the center allow you to see the colorful tropical fish one you're anchored near the reef, and if you want a closer look you can don some flippers and a snorkel and dive in.
                        The friendly local crew entertains with their singing and drumming, and afterwards you'll be taken to a barbecue on one of the islands.
                        A couple of operators run these tours, and are pretty similar. It's a good idea to book a few days in advance, as spaces fill up quickly.
