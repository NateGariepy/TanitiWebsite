Hello! 

You are likely a WGU student trying to figure out how to review this. Please export the entire C856 folder into your favorite editor and open with live server view.
I use Visual Studio Code and the extension for this is called: Live Server 
This will allow you to see each webpage rendered inside your browser. 
Thank you!
